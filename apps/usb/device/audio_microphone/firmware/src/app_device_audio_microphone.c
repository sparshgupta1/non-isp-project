 * resolution.  The audio input is specified in this example to be a 16-bit 
 * microphone, but during testing on various OSes showed that some systems have
 * trouble receiving more than a 10-bit input without causing distortion.
 *
 * The data below is generated via the following formula:
 *   audioSamples[x] = 1024 * sine(2 * pi * (x+1)/8000Hz/200Hz) for x=0:39
 * x=0:39 because there are 40 samples required for one full cycle of the sine
 * wave (8000Hz/200Hz = exactly 40 samples/cycle).
